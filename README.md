# Youtube simple web server video
This text file is used by me when creating a webserver using aws ec2 instance and record it for youtube video.
I make this video to help begginers making their first simple website.
This is absoultly not the best practice making websites on aws but its a good start for begginers.
Hope it can help you guys
